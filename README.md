"The Server side programming" is not a established technical term, insted, just my humble idea for the following 2 purpose.
* Protect valuable software running on the unsecure device.
* Handle unpredictable situation on the device.

At 23th june 2018, I've serched "Server Side Device Programming" but I can't find any same idea.
So, I think this might be my coined word and the contents are totally my humble personal idea without academic background.
But, If there are already same idea, please kindly tell me it, I'm so glad to learn it.
