# Introduction

## Background
In case of IoT system, we tend to face a situation that we have to use a device platform which has only poor security feature.
For Example, removable SD CARD which can be copied by maliciou person,
console whom password can be changed (I can easy imagine your are astonishment, but this is for resucue boot in case forgotten password).  

## Motivation
Even in the situation mentioned above, we have strong motivation to protect our ***valuable Software's*** from malicious person.
The expected protection is not only from malicious copy, but also tanperring, hijackking.
For example, suppose there are IoT system which watching room temperature. If malicious person hijack the system and send several handreds degree of room temprature,
system might it misunderstood as fire trouble and make a fire extinguisher on.
That's why we want to guard our Software running on the ***non secure platform***.
