"The Server side programming" is not a established technical term, insted, just my humble idea for the following 2 purpose.
* Protect valuable software running on the unsecure device.
* Handle unpredictable situation on the device.

I've been searching the method, tools or tutorial for the problem domain mentioned above, about 4 years.
But, with my weak searchability, I still can't find any of it at 23th june 2018.
So, following document is just a personal report of my humble of opinion, just point of view, experiment, implementation, and research ***with*** my coined word *** Server Side Device Programming***, ***without*** any authoritative academic and engineering works.
Any of your feedback is truly welcome! I really appreciate your pointing out my misunderstanding, mistake, and many of my typo! Thank you.
